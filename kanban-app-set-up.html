    <H1>How to set up the Kanban App</H1>
    <H2>Prerequisites</H2>
    <P>The Kanban App is a Java web application archive
        (&quot;war&quot; file). To run it you need to have a box running
        a Java web application server such as Tomcat or Jetty. Ideally
        you should have experience with deploying Java web applications
        to your application server and you will need to know the host
        name and port number of your application server.</P>
    <H2>Deploy kanban.war</H2>
    <P>Deploy the kanban.war file to the web application server.
        Application servers typically allow you to do this by copying
        the war file to the application server's webapps directory.
        There may also be an &quot;manager&quot; website you can connect
        to that will allow you to deploy the war file by uploading it
        from a web page.</P>
    <H2>Verify deployment</H2>
    <P>Verify the installation. Navigate to
        http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/kanban. If you are connecting
        from the box that is running the web application server you can
        use &quot;localhost&quot; for &lt;host&gt;. The port is probably
        either 80 (the standard port) or 8080. If you connect to this
        URL you should see a page like this:
    <DIV STYLE="border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 15px 0px 15px">
        <h1>Kanban App</h1>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th style="text-align: left">Version</th>
                <td>24</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th style="text-align: left">Kanban Home</th>
                <td>/home/username/.kanban</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            <a href="">Click here</a> to create the Kanban Home
            directory with a sample project.
        </p>
    </DIV>
    <H2>Configure a project</H2>
    <P>Click where it says “click here” and the Kanban App will
        create you a sample project to experiment with. You can create
        other projects by clicking the “Create Project” button from
        within the sample project.</P>
    <H2>Verify configuration</H2>
    <P>You should now see one project listed, the sample project.
        Click on the project and check that you can navigate to the
        Backlog, Wall and Completed pages. Experiment with creating
        features and stories and verify that you can move them through
        all their phases.</P>
    <H1>The project configuration</H1>
    <P>We don't have a configuration UI at this stage, so to set up
        a project you need to copy an existing project or build the
        project structure and create a kanban.properties file by hand:</P>
    <PRE>&lt;kanban home&gt;/&lt;project name&gt;/kanban.properties</PRE>
    <H2>Declare the work-item types</H2>
    <P>The work item types are the categories of work item like
        features and stories. You declare them like this:</P>
    <PRE>workItemTypes=feature,story </PRE>
    <H2>Configure the work-item types</H2>
    <P>Then, for each work item type you specify its parent, its
        phases and the colours to use on the web page:</P>
    <PRE>workItemTypes.feature.parent=root 
workItemTypes.feature.phases=Backlog,Design,Implement,Accept,Complete 
workItemTypes.feature.cardColour=6698FF 
workItemTypes.feature.backgroundColour=C6DEFF 

workItemTypes.story.parent=feature 
workItemTypes.story.phases=Development,Test 
workItemTypes.story.cardColour=ECD672 
workItemTypes.story.backgroundColour=FAF8CC</PRE>
    <P>The &quot;parent&quot; property creates a hierarchy. In this
        case, stories are subtypes of features and features are the root
        work item type.</P>
    <H2>Configure the board phases</H2>
    <P>Finally you specify which phases should appear on the Wall
        and Completed boards:</P>
    <PRE>boards.wall=Design,Implement,Development,Test,Accept 
boards.completed=Complete</PRE>
    <P>So in this case the &quot;wall&quot; board contains phases
        for both features and stories, but the &quot;completed&quot;
        board only contains features. The &quot;backlog&quot; board only
        ever contains the top-level work items (i.e. features), and it
        is hard-coded to list items in the first phase in the sequence
        (in our example, the Backlog phase).</P>
    <P>There are error messages in the stack trace if the project
        configuration is wrong. Hopefully these are pretty clear.</P>
